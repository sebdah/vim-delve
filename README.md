vim-delve
=========

This is a Neovim and Vim plugin for debugging [Go](https://golang.org)
applications using [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve). The project
works a lot nicer on Neovim with the built-in terminal, so that's what we
recommend. But it is decent to work with on Vim if you have
[Shougo/vimshell.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell.vim) installed.

please follow [@sebdah](https://twitter.com/sebdah) on Twitter!*

Feature highlights
------------------

- Go syntax highlighting of debug output (only Neovim)
- Supports both breakpoints and tracepoints
- Run the Delve debugger in a split view along side your code
- Launches a Delve CLI, so all commands are supported in there
- Leverages the Neovim terminal (only on Neovim)
- Supports `main` as well as and non-`main` packages

Requirements
------------

- [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve)

If you are on vim (not neovim), you'll also need the following two packages:

- [Shougo/vimshell.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell.vim)
- [Shougo/vimproc.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim)

Installation
------------

Using `vim-plug`, add the following to your `init.vim` if you're on Neovim or
`.vimrc`, if you're on vim:

`Plug 'sebdah/vim-delve'`

Then reload neovim and run `PlugInstall`.

Contributions to the project is most welcome. I'd be happy to review and merge
pull requests. If you need any directions in your implementation we can always
discuss that too.

### What can I do to help?

There are many things that this project need, but some examples could be:

- I don't know if this works on Windows. If you could try it out and or make it
    work that would be great.
- I haven't tested the project thoroughly on Vim, if you could do that it'd be
    wonderful.
- Answer [questions from users](https://github.com/sebdah/vim-delve/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- Or implement [new features](https://github.com/sebdah/vim-delve/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)
